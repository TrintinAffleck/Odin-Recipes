        <li>2 tsp onion powder</li>
        <li>2 tsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>3 cups (750ml) chicken stock</li>
        <li>400g chicken tenderloins-skinless</li>
        <li>150g green beans<em>trimmed & cut in thirds</em></li>
        <li>1/4 bunch of fresh flat leaf parsnips (5oz bunch) <em>roughly chopped</em></li>
    </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat and saute carrots and parsnip for 5-10 
            minutes, or until tender. Season well with salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>Add rice and stir through for a minute or two.</li>
        <li>Add onion powder, garlic powder and stock. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer.
            Cover and simmer gently for 20 minutes, stirring regularly. Adjust seasoning.
        </li>
        <li>Add chicken in an even layer, cover and simmer for another 15 minutes or until chicken is cooked through. 
            (You may need to add a little more stock or water if necessary.)
        </li>
        <li>Remove chicken from the skillet and set aside. Add beans and continue to cook for another 4-5 minutes or until beans are just 
            cooked.
        </li>
        <li>Whilst beans cook, dice or shred chicken and return to the skillet.</li>
        <li>Divide between bowls, top with parsley and serve.</li>
    </ol>
